## What is Cinefiles?
Cinefiles is a website consisting of a movie-lover community engaged and commited to sharing about their favorite, and least favorite movies. Users will be able to create reviews, comment on others, and develop a personal webpage to reflect their own personality and tastes.  
In order for a 'complete' Cinefiles experience, the final product aims to be feature complete with  
- Review posting
- Comment on existing reviews
- Be easily navigatable through the combination of a list and detail page
- When creating a review, have a list of applicable movies to automatically update the thumbnail for the reviews

And finally, the centerpiece of our user profile features  
Users will all have a profile page, consisting of their favorite movies, a watch list, their recent reviews, and possibly other features such as a biography if time allows.

## What does a completed product look like?

Upon opening the home page, users will see multiple options.  
First, and most prominent, will be the review feed.
Nextly, is the navigation bar present on all pages. This will feature the home button, login functions, and finally the option to create a new review if logged in. 

Clicking a review card will access the review's details, including the ability to access the writer's profile or write a comment.
Clicking on your name on the navigation bar will also bring you to your own profile page

Your profile page will feature your list of top 5 movies, a watch list, and your recent reviews which can be accessed in a similar manner to the review feed/homepage.
You will also be able to edit your user information here aswell, including changing your password if you are already logged in.

Creating a new review from the navbelt will allow you to name your review, select the movie title from a database, and finally write the review. The author and thumbnail fields will ideally be automatically populated.
